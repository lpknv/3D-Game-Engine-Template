# 3D Game Engine Template for Windows

## What is this?
This is a fork from Ted Bendixsons [3D Game Engine Template](https://github.com/TheoBendixson/3D-Game-Engine-Template).

I do plan to add some demos to this repo for people interested in making things from scratch. SDL2 is currently used in this repo, but maybe in some future it will be changed to SDL3 or something else.
